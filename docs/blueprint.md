## Original User Request:
I want to create a login page, which is connected to an sqlite database. The login page will have two option login by admin and login by employee.I want to create 2 dashboard pages. One for admin and one for Employee. Admin dashboard will have a section to add employee where we can create employees and add them to database so they could log in using the id password provided by the admin, one to manage employee where we will have the names of all the empyees with id and for products. In product we will have a product called bopp tape and on clicking on that it shows a button which will redirect it to BoppCalculator. In the employee dashboard it will only have a section for product and after that it will be same as the admin.
